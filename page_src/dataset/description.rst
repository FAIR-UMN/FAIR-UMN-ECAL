The data is provided for all 75848 crystals starting from 2016 through 2018. It includes the following columns.

    #.  **xtal\_id**: Crystal Identification number within ECAL ranging from [0, 75848].
    #.  **start\_ts**: Start of interval of validity (IOV).
    #.  **stop\_ts**: End of IOV.
    #.  **laser\_datetime**: Timestamp of the measurement for a given crystal within an IOV.
    #.  **calibration**: APD/PD ratio taken at laser\_datetime.
    #.  **time**: Time corresponding to the luminosity measurement (obtained from BRIL) closest to the laser\_datetime.
    #.  **int\_deliv\_inv\_ub**: Approximate integrated luminosity delivered up to the measurement in the units of micro barn inverse.
