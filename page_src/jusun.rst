NCVX Methods
======================================================

General nonconvex optimization is undoubtedly hard â€” in 
sharp contrast to convex optimization, of which there is 
good separation of problem structure, input data, and 
optimization algorithms. But many nonconvex problems of interest 
become amenable to simple and practical algorithms and rigorous 
analyses once the artificial separation is removed.
